        "description":"Throughout postnatal life, haematopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) maintains blood and immune cell production. Haematopoiesis first emerges in human BM at 11-12 post conception weeks while fetal liver (FL) haematopoiesis is still expanding. Yet, almost nothing is known about how fetal BM evolves to meet the highly specialised needs of the fetus and newborn infant. Here, we detail the development of fetal BM including stroma using single cell RNA-sequencing. We find that the full blood and immune cell repertoire is established in fetal BM in a short time window of 6-7 weeks early in the second trimester. Fetal BM promotes rapid and extensive diversification of myeloid cells, with granulocytes, eosinophils and dendritic cell subsets emerging for the first time. B-lymphocytes expansion occurs, in contrast with erythroid predominance in FL at the same gestational age. We identify transcriptional and functional differences that underlie tissue-specific identity and cellular diversification in fetal BM and FL. Finally, we reveal selective disruption of B-lymphocyte, erythroid and myeloid development due to cell intrinsic differentiation bias as well as extrinsic regulation through an altered microenvironment in the fetal BM from constitutional chromosome anomaly Down syndrome during this crucial developmental time window. Overall design: Sample RBG33493 is a pool of MNCs from three stage 3 fetal bone marrow samples (F90, F103, F107). Sample RBG33494 is a pool of CD34+ cells from two adult bone marrow samples (CIMA-60, CIMA-58) and one stage 3 fetal bone marrow sample (F103). Sample RBG33496 is a pool of CD34+ cells from two adult bone marrow samples (CIMA-90, CIMA-100) and one stage 3 fetal bone marrow sample (F107). Sample RBG33500 is a pool of CD34+ cells from two stage 2 fetal liver samples (F94 and F96) and one stage 1 fetal liver sample (F109). Sample RBG33503 is CD34+ cells from a one stage 2 fetal bone marrow sample (F96). Samples RBG33507 and RBG33508 are technical replicates of a pool of CD34+ cells from three stage 3 fetal liver samples (F90, F103, F107). Sample RBG31066 is a pool of CD34+ cells from four new born cord blood samples (XN3392). Individuals not analysed for this article - CIMA-60, CIMA-58, CIMA-90, CIMA-100, F94 and F109.

        "description":"Haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), the precursors of all blood cells, reside predominantly in the bone marrow (BM). Recent evidence suggests that other anatomical sites may contribute significantly to blood production, but the cellular, molecular and functional composition of extramedullary HSPC pools remains unexplored. Here, we comprehensively characterized the single-cell composition of the adult human HSPC pool within paired BM, spleen and peripheral blood (PB) from two healthy organ donors. 10x scRNA-seq of 30000 HSPCs from all three sites defined transcriptionally distinct cell clusters that correspond to precursors of all haematopoietic lineages but also stem cells (HSCs). Although most clusters were common to all organs, their proportions significantly differed between tissues. Altogether our data provides evidence that different organs sustain distinct topologies of the hematopoietic hierarchy, originating from HSC subsets with distinct lineage preferences.\n\nThis dataset is part of the Human Cell Atlas.",

Here, we use single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to define the heterogeneity of human T cells isolated from lungs, lymph nodes, bone marrow and blood, and their functional responses following stimulation. Through analysis of >50,000 resting and activated T cells, we reveal tissue T cell signatures in mucosal and lymphoid sites, and lineage-specific activation states across all sites including distinct effector states for CD8+ T cells and an interferon-response state for CD4+ T cells. Comparing scRNA-seq profiles of tumor-associated T cells to our dataset reveals predominant activated CD8+ compared to CD4+ T cell states within multiple tumor types. Our results therefore establish a high dimensional reference map of human T cell activation in health for analyzing T cells in disease.",

We chose renal clear cell carcinoma tumors based on the responsive of these tumors to immune checkpoint blockade in the context of low mutational loads, which implies a strong influence from the tumor microenvironment. Using the 10x Genomic 5 expression platform a total of 25,672 immune cells were isolated and passed filtering for quality control, with 13,433 cells from peripheral blood and 12,239 tumor-infiltrating cells. In addition, we used the Chromium Single Cell V(D)J kit to enrich for T cell receptor sequences for nearly 10,000 T cells in with accompanying expression information, allowing for the investigation of clonality and transcriptional phenotypic diversity. We generated a comprehensive immune profile using single-cell RNA-seq data from 25,000 immune cells from three renal cell carcinoma along with matched peripheral blood. In addition, we performed VDJ sequencing on the isolated single T cells. Overall design: T cell receptor sequences of the subset of T cells in the 5' RNA expression sequencing dataset.",

Here, we assessed the transcriptional profiles of 131,224 single cells from peripheral and intra-tumoral CD45+ immune populations from HPV– and HPV+ HNSCC and healthy donors. A spectrum of transcriptional signatures in immune lineages ranging from similar to highly divergent was present in the tumor microenvironments (TME) in HPV– and HPV+ HNSCC. CD8+ and regulatory CD4+ T cells were similar in HPV– and HPV+ HNSCC, compared to significant differences between helper CD4+ T cells, B cells and myeloid cells. Further dissection of the major immune lineages identified unique cell states and differentiation trajectories. We contextualized our results by performing multispectral immunofluorescence and evaluating putative cell-cell communication based on spatial proximity, and found longer progression free survival in patients with enrichment of a CD4+ T follicular helper cell signature. Overall design: Total of 63 samples were analyzed by scRNAseq. Of these, 26 samples were paired peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumor infiltrating immune cells from HNSCC patients (18 HPV- and 8 HPV+), 6 were peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors, and 5 were tissue resident immune cells from healthy donor tonsils.",
