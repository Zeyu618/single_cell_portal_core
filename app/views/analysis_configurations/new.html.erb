<h1>New Analysis</h1>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
  <p>Use this form to register a new analysis into the portal.  Users who have compute privileges on studies will see the
    'Analysis' tab enabled, and this analysis will be available in the dropdown menu for users to select.  Once the analysis
    has been added, you will be able to further configure the parameters to control how the workflow submission form is
    rendered, and any special behavior when users sync successful submissions of this analysis (like how to parse output
    files, and what associations to set, if any).
  </p>
  <p><strong>You will need to provide the namespace, name, and snapshot for both the analysis method AND a valid configuration
    that corresponds with the analysis.  Both must be publicly visible in the methods repository.</strong>
